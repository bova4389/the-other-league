# CLAUDE.md — The Other League Dynasty Dashboard

## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

A personal fantasy football dashboard for "The Other League" — a 12-team dynasty league on the Sleeper platform. The site pulls live data from the Sleeper public API to display rosters, league history, draft picks, scoring rules, rivalries, and a trade evaluator with live KTC values.

**Commissioner:** Matt Bova. Built for personal use, shared with league mates via GitHub Pages.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

This is a **static HTML/JavaScript project** — no framework, no build step, no package manager. All files are plain `.html` with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

```
the-other-league/                      — repo root
├── index.html                         — THE working file (3300+ lines, all logic embedded)
├── TOL Large Logo.png                 — hero image (home panel + sticky header)
├── TOL Small Logo.png                 — available if needed
├── TOL Abbreviated Icon.png           — favicon + iOS add-to-homescreen icon
├── TOL iPhone background image.png    — iOS splash screen
└── Sleeper FF/The Other League/
    ├── CLAUDE.md                      — you are here
    ├── index.html                     — redirect stub to root site
    └── the-other-league-context.md    — master league context document
```

**Current state:** `index.html` at the **repo root** is the **only** file to edit. It contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file. The logo PNGs are also at the repo root alongside it.

**Deployment:** GitHub Pages (static hosting). Push to `main` → site updates automatically. Live at `https://bova4389.github.io/the-other-league/`

## EXTERNAL APIS

### Sleeper API (no auth required)
- Base: `https://api.sleeper.app/v1`
- League ID: `1316225642072662016`
- Key endpoints:
  - `/league/{lid}` — league info
  - `/league/{lid}/rosters` — all 12 rosters
  - `/league/{lid}/traded_picks` — pick trade log
  - `/league/{lid}/matchups/{week}` — matchup scores for a given week
  - `/league/{lid}/transactions/{week}` — transactions for a given week
  - `/league/{lid}/drafts` — drafts list
  - `/draft/{draft_id}/picks` — picks for a draft
  - `/players/nfl` — full player database (~5MB, slow)
  - `/stats/nfl/regular/{year}/{week}` — actual player stats for a completed week
  - `/projections/nfl/{year}/{week}` — projected player stats (**no "regular" in path** — different from stats endpoint)
- CORS note: Direct browser fetch may fail. Fallback proxies in order: `corsproxy.io`, `api.allorigins.win`

### Anthropic API
- Used **only** by `getTradeAI()` inside the Trade Evaluator panel
- The "Ask Claude" tab was removed from the UI (panel and icon tab are gone)
- `sendAI()`, `addMsg()`, `clearChat()`, `aiMessages`, `LEAGUE_CONTEXT`, `QUICK_PROMPTS` remain in JS because `getTradeAI()` calls them — do not delete them

---

## NAVIGATION STRUCTURE

### Sticky Shell
`<div class="sticky-shell">` uses `position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 100`. It contains:
1. `<header>` — logo (home link) + "Open in Sleeper" pill + dark mode toggle
2. `<nav class="icon-nav">` — 9 icon tabs + 1 refresh button

The header logo (`<div class="hdr-logo-link">`) calls `showTab('home')` on click — it IS the home button.

### Icon Nav
Each tab is `<div class="icon-tab" onclick="showTab('id',this)" data-tab="id">` with an emoji icon and text label. The active tab gets `class="active"` and a teal bottom border.

The Refresh button at the end is `<div class="icon-tab nav-refresh-btn" onclick="refreshData()">` — styled with a left border separator; it never gets the active class.

**Mobile layout (≤ 680px):** The nav wraps into two rows of 5 using `flex-wrap: wrap` with each tab at `width: 20%`. Row 1: Careers, League, Rivalries, Scores, Rosters. Row 2: Stats, Draft, **Txns** (label shortened from "Transactions"), Trade Eval, Refresh. Labels use 8px font with tighter letter-spacing on mobile. Desktop remains a single scrollable row.

### URL Hash Routing
`showTab(tab, el)` calls `history.replaceState(null,'','#'+tab)`. On boot, `routeFromHash()` reads `location.hash` and navigates to the matching tab. `hashchange` event is also wired. Valid tab IDs are in `VALID_TABS` array in JS.

### `body.is-home` CSS Class
`document.body.classList.toggle('is-home', tab==='home')` — set in HTML on `<body class="is-home">` at load, toggled in `showTab()`. CSS rules under `body.is-home` hide the sidebar, cache bar, and utility strips, and give the home panel edge-to-edge layout.

### Tabs and Panels

| Icon | Tab Label | `showTab` ID | Panel ID | Lazy load? |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| (logo click) | Home | `home` | `panel-home` | No — static HTML with countdown JS |
| 📊 | Careers | `careers` | `panel-careers` | Yes — `buildCareers()` on first visit |
| ℹ️ | League | `league` | `panel-league` | No — static HTML |
| ⚔️ | Rivalries | `rivalries` | `panel-rivalries` | Re-renders every visit via `buildRivalries()` |
| 🏈 | Scores | `scores` | `panel-scores` | Yes — `buildScores()` on first visit. Year tabs: 2026 (default), 2025, 2024, 2023. W15–W17 marked "PLAYOFFS". W4/W13 pills turn pink for rivalry years. |
| 📋 | Rosters | `rosters` | `panel-rosters` | No — loaded at boot via `init()` |
| 📈 | Stats | `stats` | `panel-stats` | Yes — `buildPlayerStats()` on first visit |
| 🎯 | Draft | `draft` | `panel-draft` | Yes — `buildDraft2026()` at boot; past years on demand |
| 🔄 | Transactions | `transactions` | `panel-transactions` | Yes — `buildTransactions()` on first visit |
| ⚖️ | Trade Eval | `trade` | `panel-trade` | Yes — `initTradeEval()` on first visit |
| ↺ | Refresh | — | — | Calls `refreshData()` directly; not a panel tab |

**Removed tabs:** "Ask Claude" (`ai` / `panel-ai`) was removed from the UI. The underlying JS functions are kept because `getTradeAI()` uses them.

### Home Panel (`panel-home`)
Contains:
- `TOL Large Logo.png` as hero image with neon glow (`.home-hero-logo`)
- NFL Season countdown to **Sep 9, 2026 8:20 PM ET** — `startCountdown()` function, IDs: `cd-days`, `cd-hours`, `cd-mins`, `cd-secs`
- 2025 Champion card: Jake Blackwell / "Nacua Matata" / Pick 1.12
- League meta pills: Commissioner · Matt Bova, Est. · 2023, Dynasty · 12 Teams

**Removed from home panel:** Consolation winner card (Nick Merkel), Quick-nav grid (replaced by icon nav)

### Careers Panel (`panel-careers`)
Contains:
1. Section title "LEAGUE LEADERS" + subtitle
2. `.career-status-bar` — the perpetual stats bar (7 `.s-pill` items) — **lives here, not globally**
3. `#careers-container` — career stats table + per-season standings tables (built by `buildCareers()`)

The perpetual stats bar was formerly a global `.status` div shown above all panels. It was moved inside this panel so it only appears on the Careers tab.

---

## REMOVED / HIDDEN ELEMENTS

- **Sidebar** (`.sidebar`) — `display: none !important` — the All Teams team list is gone. `buildSidebar()` and `scrollToTeam()` still exist in JS but sidebar is invisible.
- **Cache bar** (`.cache-bar`) — `display: none !important` inline style — the "Cached data · Last fetched Xm ago · Refresh" row is hidden. The DOM elements and IDs (`cache-dot`, `cache-status-txt`, `refresh-btn`) still exist in the HTML so `setCacheBar()` and `refreshData()` work correctly.
- **Sleeper bar** (`.sleeper-bar`) — removed from HTML. "Open in Sleeper" link moved to the header.

---

## KEY ELEMENT IDs

### Header
- `t-icon`, `t-lbl` — theme toggle icon and label
- `cache-dot` — colored dot (live vs cached) — inside hidden `.cache-bar`
- `cache-status-txt` — cache status message — inside hidden `.cache-bar`
- `refresh-btn` — original refresh button — inside hidden `.cache-bar`; `refreshData()` still uses it programmatically

### Perpetual Stats (inside `panel-careers`)
- `stat-champs` — past champions list
- `stat-earn-val`, `stat-earn-sub` — highest career earnings
- `stat-wins-val`, `stat-wins-sub` — most career wins
- `stat-cons-val`, `stat-cons-sub` — most consistent finisher
- `stat-picks-val`, `stat-picks-sub` — most draft picks
- `stat-trades-val`, `stat-trades-sub` — most trades completed
- `stat-worst-val`, `stat-worst-sub` — worst average finish

### Scores Panel
- `scores-container` — main scores area

### Rosters Panel
- `rosters-container` — roster grid (12 `r-card` divs)

- `roster-team-chips` — multi-select team filter chip bar (built by `buildTeamFilterChips`)

### Rivalries Panel
- `rivalry-grid` — rivalry matchup cards

### Draft Panel
- `draft-view-past` — visible by default; all years including 2026 render here via `buildDraftHistory()`

- `d26-list-view`, `d26-board-view`, `d26-tbody` — inside the hidden 2026 view
- `draft-history-container` — inside `draft-view-past`; holds rendered picks
- `draft-team-chips` — multi-select team filter chip bar above the year toggle

### Player Stats Panel
- `stats-yr-toggle`, `stats-pos-filter`, `stats-wk-filter`, `stats-container`
- `sg-pass`, `sg-rush`, `sg-rec` — stat group toggle buttons (Passing / Rushing / Receiving); toggling rebuilds the table
- `stats-team-chips` — multi-select team filter chip bar (includes "All Teams" + "Free Agents" + one chip per team); built once by `buildStatsTeamChips()`; filters rows via `applyStatsFilters()` show/hide (no re-fetch)

### Transactions Panel
- `txn-container`, `txn-yr-toggle`, `txn-filter-bar`, `txn-player-search`, `txn-player-results`

## JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS

### Theme
- `toggleTheme()` — toggles `data-theme` on `<html>`, saves to `localStorage`
- `applyTheme()` — restores saved theme on page load

### Cache
- `saveCache(rosters)` — writes roster data + timestamp to `localStorage[tol_cache_v2]`
- `loadCache()` — returns `null` if missing or older than 6h
- `clearCache()` — removes `tol_cache_v2`
- `savePerm(key, data)` / `loadPerm(key)` — permanent localStorage (no TTL, for historical data)
- `setCacheBar(fromCache, ts)` — updates cache dot, text, refresh button (still called even though bar is hidden)
- `refreshData()` — clears cache, resets state, re-runs `init()`

### Sleeper API
- `api(path)` — fetches from Sleeper with CORS fallback chain (direct → corsproxy.io → allorigins.win)
- `findLeagueIds()` — walks `previous_league_id` chain to discover past season IDs; caches in `tol_lids`

### Matchups / H2H
- `fetchAllMatchups(leagueId, year)` — fetches all 17 weeks; caches in `tol_matchups_{year}`
- `buildH2HMap()` — all-time H2H record map from all cached seasons; returns `h2h[ridA][ridB] = {w, l}`
- `buildH2HForYear(year)` — same but single season

### Stats Banner (Perpetual Stats)
- `buildLeaderStats()` — computes and renders all 7 perpetual stats from `SEASON_HISTORY` + cached pick/transaction data. Called at boot and after each background data fetch. Targets IDs inside `panel-careers`.

### Careers
- `buildCareers()` — calls `buildLeaderStats()` to refresh pills, then builds the career earnings/placement table and per-season standings tables

### Scores Tab
State variables: `currentScoresYear` (default 2026), `currentScoresWeek` (default 1)

- `buildScores()` — fetches matchups for `currentScoresYear` via `findLeagueIds()` + `fetchAllMatchups()`, then calls `renderHistoricalScores()`
- `renderHistoricalScores(container, matchups, week)` — renders matchup cards; handles 2026 "projected" banner + `—` scores for pre-season; applies bracket chips from `PLAYOFF_BRACKET_INFO`; applies rivalry banner from `RIVALRY_WEEKS`
- `setScoresYear(year, el)` — switches year tab, resets to W1, calls `updateRivalryPills(year)`, rebuilds scores
- `setScoresWeek(week, el)` — switches week pill, rebuilds scores
- `goToScoresWeek(year, week)` — navigates from Rivalries tab: switches to scores tab, sets year+week, calls `updateRivalryPills(year)`, rebuilds scores
- `updateRivalryPills(year)` — toggles `.rivalry` class on W4/W13 pills based on `RIVALRY_WEEKS[year]`; called whenever year changes

### Team Filter Chips (shared — Rosters, Draft, Transactions)
State variables: `currentTxnTeams`, `currentRosterTeams`, `currentDraftTeams` — each a `Set` of `roster_id` numbers; empty = all teams.

- `buildTeamFilterChips(containerId, teamSet, onToggle)` — builds "All Teams" + one chip per team into the container div; guarded by `dataset.built` so it only runs once per container
- `syncTeamChips(containerId, teamSet)` — updates active state on chips to match the current Set
- `uidToRid(uid)` — converts a `user_id` string to its numeric `roster_id`
- `applyRosterFilter()` — shows/hides `r-card` elements in `#rosters-container` based on `currentRosterTeams`
- `applyDraftFilter()` — re-renders `renderDraftPicks` and (if board was built) `renderDraftBoard` using `_draftPicks` and `currentDraftTeams`

### Rosters
- `buildRosters(rostersData, playersData)` — renders 12 roster cards with position-colored player chips; calls `buildTeamFilterChips` and `applyRosterFilter` after rendering

### Rivalries
- `buildRivalries()` — renders 6 rivalry cards; re-renders on every tab visit; always shows a "2026: TBD · W4 W13" placeholder row for each rivalry until live matchup data is available
- `buildH2HForYear(year, maxWeek)` — builds H2H map from cached matchup data for a single year (up to `maxWeek`; default 17)
- `findRivalWeeks(year, ridA, ridB, maxWeek)` — returns sorted list of week numbers where two roster IDs faced each other (default `maxWeek=14`)

### Player Stats
State variables: `currentStatsYear` (default 2026), `currentStatsPos` (default `'all'`), `currentStatsWeek` (default `'season'`), `statsShowPass`, `statsShowRush`, `statsShowRec` (all default `true` — control column group visibility), `currentStatsTeams` (Set — roster_ids; `0` = free agents; empty = all teams).

- `fetchPlayerStats(year)` / `fetchWeekStats(year, week)` — fetches and caches stat data for 2023–2025 (permanent localStorage)
- `fetch2026SeasonStats()` — fetches all 17 weeks of actuals (`/stats/nfl/regular/2026/{week}`) + projections (`/projections/nfl/2026/{week}`) in parallel; identifies completed weeks by `gp >= 1`; aggregates actuals and projected separately; caches in session-only `_stats2026Cache` (cleared on Refresh, not localStorage)
- `fetch2026WeekStats(week)` — tries actuals first; falls back to projections if no `gp >= 1` data
- `calcPts(stats, pos)` — calculates fantasy points using `SDATA`. **Note:** Projections API returns different field names than stats API — projection aggregation must capture all numeric fields (not filter by STAT_KEYS) or use `pts_std`/`pts_half_ppr`/`pts_ppr` fallback.
- `build2026Stats(c, pos)` — 2026 renderer; season view shows dual "Act. Pts" / "Proj Pts" columns; week view shows actuals or projected with PROJ chip; uses unified column builder (same as `buildPlayerStats`)
- `buildPlayerStats(year, posFilter)` — renders stats table for all years; routes to `build2026Stats` if year is 2026; uses unified column builder (no position-specific if/else)
- `toggleStatGroup(group, el)` — toggles `statsShowPass`/`statsShowRush`/`statsShowRec`, calls `buildPlayerStats`
- `setStatsYear()`, `setStatsWeek()`, `setStatsPos()` — filter handlers
- `buildStatsTeamChips()` — builds "All Teams" + "Free Agents" + per-team chips into `#stats-team-chips`; guarded by `dataset.built` so it only runs once. Free Agents = `rid 0` (players in stats but not on any roster). Called at end of both `build2026Stats` and `buildPlayerStats`.
- `applyStatsFilters()` — shows/hides `tr[data-pid]` rows using `data-rid` attribute; AND-combines team filter (`currentStatsTeams`) with player search/selection filter. Each `<tr>` in the stats table has `data-rid="{roster_id}"` (0 for free agents).

**Unified column builder** (used in both `build2026Stats` and `buildPlayerStats`): Passing columns shown only for QB + All/Rookie views; Rushing for QB/RB/WR + All/Rookie; Receiving for RB/WR/TE + All/Rookie. TE Prem column added when `pos==='TE'` and Receiving is enabled. Non-applicable cells render `—`. NFL Team column only shown on All/Rookie views.

**Rookie tag:** `isRookieInYear(pid, year)` uses Sleeper `years_exp` field (`years_exp === 0` = 2026 rookie, `1` = 2025 rookie, etc.). `[RK]` tag rendered via `.rk-tag` span inside the player chip. A legend note appears below the scoring note when any player in the filtered view has `[RK]`.

### Transactions
- `fetchTransactions(leagueId, year)` — fetches and permanently caches past transactions
- `buildTransactions(filter, year)` — renders filtered list; calls `buildTeamFilterChips` on first run; filters by `currentTxnTeams` (multi-select Set — matches any transaction touching any selected team)
- `runPlayerSearch(query)` — searches all seasons + draft history for a player

### Draft
- `buildDraft2026()` — **never called** — dead code; `d26-tbody` is never populated; `draft-view-2026` stays hidden
- `buildDraftHistory(year)` — fetches and renders past draft results for ALL years (including 2026); calls `buildTeamFilterChips` after rendering
- `renderDraftPicks(container, picks, year)` — filters picks by `currentDraftTeams` before rendering
- `renderDraftBoard(picks, year)` — filters picks by `currentDraftTeams` before rendering (shows only selected teams' columns on board view)

### Tab Navigation
- `showTab(tab, el)` — activates tab + panel; triggers lazy-load on first visit; toggles `body.is-home`; updates URL hash

### Trade Evaluator
- `initTradeEval()` — lazy-init: populates team dropdowns, kicks off `fetchKTCValues()`
- `fetchKTCValues()` — tries live KTC JSON; falls back to `KTC_SNAPSHOT` if < 50 players returned
- `evaluateTrade()` — computes value delta using KTC values, renders result card
- `getTradeAI(giveUid, receiveUid)` — calls Claude API with trade details

### Boot
- `startCountdown()` — countdown timer to **Sep 9, 2026 8:20 PM ET**; ticks every 1s
- `routeFromHash()` — reads `location.hash` on boot and navigates to matching tab
- `init()` — boot sequence: loads/caches rosters, builds leader stats, prefetches historical data in background

### Automation (Tuesday Bot)
Weekly automation that runs every Tuesday at 9am ET (after Monday Night Football) to update `h2h-records.md` with the prior week's H2H results.

- **`scripts/tuesday_update.py`** — fetches `state/nfl` to detect current week, fetches matchups from Sleeper API, parses and rewrites `h2h-records.md`. Flags: `--week N`, `--dry-run`, `--force`. Tracks applied weeks in `scripts/bot_state.json`.
- **`.github/workflows/tuesday-update.yml`** — GitHub Actions cron (Tuesday 1pm UTC); also has manual trigger with week/dry-run/force inputs. Commits `h2h-records.md` + `bot_state.json` if changed.
- **`scripts/run_tuesday_update.bat`** — Windows launcher called by Task Scheduler; logs to `scripts/tuesday_update.log`.
- **`scripts/setup_scheduled_task.ps1`** — one-time setup to register the Windows Task Scheduler task. Task is **dormant until Sep 9, 2026** (`StartBoundary`); fires on next boot if PC was off at 9am.
- **`.github/workflows/season-reminder.yml`** — GitHub Actions creates a GitHub Issue on Sep 2, 2026 as a reminder to activate the bot; GitHub emails the repo owner automatically.

## VISUAL THEME — Retro Neon Sports Broadcast

Aesthetic: late-90s ESPN2 / NFL Blitz / neon arcade sports. Dark UI with neon glow accents.

### Color Palette

| Role | Variable | Value |
|------|----------|-------|
| Primary accent | `--accent` | `#16E0D6` Electric Teal |
| Secondary accent | `--accent2` | `#7B2EFF` Neon Purple |
| Tertiary accent | `--accent3` | `#FF4FD8` Hot Pink |
| Dark background | `--bg` | `#0B1020` |
| Panel surface | `--surface` | `#111827` Deep Navy |
| Card background | `--card` | `#151B2F` |
| Borders | `--border` | `#253652` |
| Body text | `--text` | `#F9FAFB` Soft White |
| Secondary text | `--text2` | `#c4d4e8` |
| Muted text | `--muted` | `#aabdcf` (brightened — was `#8aa0be`) |

### Typography System

Three-level hierarchy — **no DM Mono for anything the user sees in main content**:

| Use Case | Font | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Section titles, stat values | **Bebas Neue** | All-caps display, sporty |
| Stat pill labels, rivalry record labels | **Bebas Neue** | Larger sizes (11–14px) with letter-spacing |
| Position badge labels (`.cp` inside `.chip`) | **DM Sans 600** | 10px, colored background badge per position — replaced Bebas Neue for readability |
| Avg Age badges and other `.bdg` chips | **DM Sans 600** | 10px — replaced Bebas Neue for readability |
| Nav tab labels | **DM Sans 700** | Bold uppercase, `letter-spacing: .14em` — Bebas Neue was too condensed |
| Body text, table cells, player chips, buttons, form elements | **DM Sans** | Clean, readable |
| Code/timestamps/KTC values (intentional monospace) | **DM Mono** | Used sparingly; never in main content areas |

### Pink Usage (accent3 `#FF4FD8`)
Pink should be prominent throughout dark mode. Currently pink is used on:
- Stat pill labels (PAST CHAMPIONS, HIGHEST CAREER EARNINGS, etc.)
- All table headers (`.dtbl th`, `.career-tbl th`) with glow
- Section subtitles (`.sec-sub`)
- Fun-card labels (`.fun-label`)
- Section row labels (`.sec-row-label`)
- Rivalry card record totals and labels
- Rivalry card top border accent stripe
- Scores tab H2H strip at bottom of each matchup card
- "Open in Sleeper" link in header

### Teal Usage (accent `#16E0D6`)
- Active nav tab bottom border and label
- Winning team left border stripe on matchup cards
- Leading score highlight
- Primary interactive hover states

### Glow System
All neon glows live in the `RETRO NEON SPORTS THEME — ENHANCEMENTS` block and the `TYPOGRAPHY OVERHAUL` block near the end of `<style>`. Scoped to `[data-theme="dark"]`. Pattern: `text-shadow: 0 0 Xpx rgba(R,G,B,0.Y)`. Keep values subtle.

### Logo Files (wired in)
- `TOL Large Logo.png` — sticky header (52px tall) and home panel hero (max 420px)
- `TOL Small Logo.png` — available if needed
- `TOL Abbreviated Icon.png` — favicon + iOS add-to-homescreen icon

### PWA / Mobile
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="TOL Abbreviated Icon.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="TOL Abbreviated Icon.png">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="The Other League">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#0B1020">
```

## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS (don't change without asking)

- **Non-PPR scoring** with TE premium (+0.5/rec) and distance bonuses
- **Dark/light theme toggle** — persists via `localStorage['tol_theme']`
- **LocalStorage caching** — Sleeper roster data cached 6h; historical data permanent
- **CORS fallback chain** — direct → corsproxy.io → allorigins.win; never remove
- **Single-file architecture** — all HTML, CSS, JS in `index.html` at the **repo root** (not inside `Sleeper FF/`)
- **Roster chips colored by position** — QB=purple, RB=green, WR=blue, TE=orange, K=gray, DEF=red. Color legend shown at top of Rosters panel using actual `.chip` elements. Number in parentheses after player name = age.
- **Position badge (`.cp`)** — the position label inside each `.chip` is styled as a small colored badge: DM Sans 600, 10px, `padding: 1px 4px`, `border-radius: 2px`, background from `--pos-XX-bg` CSS variables (semi-transparent, defined for both dark and light themes). Replaced Bebas Neue — do not revert.
- **Avg Age badges (`.bdg`)** — use DM Sans 600 at 10px. The override block near the end of `<style>` sets `font-family: 'DM Sans'` — this overrides the base `.bdg` rule. Replaced Bebas Neue — do not revert.
- **Rivalries from 2025 forward only** — pre-2025 matchups excluded from rivalry records. Rivalry weeks: W4 and W13 (both 2025 and 2026). W14 is NOT a rivalry week — a prior mistake that was corrected.
- **2026 draft is linear, not snake** — rounds 2–4 follow the same order as round 1
- **Sidebar is permanently hidden** — `display: none !important`. `scrollToTeam()` and `buildSidebar()` exist in JS but sidebar is not visible.
- **Cache bar is permanently hidden** — hidden via inline `style="display:none"` on the div. The underlying elements still exist and `refreshData()` / `setCacheBar()` still work correctly — do not remove the DOM elements.
- **Perpetual stats live in `panel-careers`** — the `.career-status-bar` inside `panel-careers` holds the stat pills. They are populated by `buildLeaderStats()` which is called at boot and after each background fetch.
- **Home panel has no quick-nav grid** — navigation is entirely via the icon nav and the logo home link
- **"Ask Claude" tab removed from UI** — the panel and icon tab are gone, but the underlying JS (`sendAI`, `addMsg`, etc.) must remain because `getTradeAI()` calls them

## DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

### Phase 1 — All-Time Records & Career Stats
**Goal:** New "Records" tab (or section within Careers) displaying all-time per-owner stats.
- All-time W/L record per owner
- Most championships, most playoff appearances
- Highest single-week score (all-time + per season)
- Biggest blowout margin, worst loss margin
- Longest win/lose streak (current + all-time)
- Most points scored in a season

**Data source:** Already in dashboard — Sleeper API + `SEASON_HISTORY` hardcoded data. **Complexity: Low.**

---

### Phase 2 — Head-to-Head Rivalry History
**Goal:** Expand the existing Rivalries tab with full all-time H2H detail.
- All-time H2H record between any two managers (clickable matchup grid)
- Full game log per rivalry (date, scores, winner)
- Average margin of victory per matchup
- "Nemesis" stat — who has the worst record against a specific opponent

**Data source:** Sleeper matchup API by week — same data used by `buildH2HMap()`. **Complexity: Low-medium.**

---

### Phase 3 — Draft History + Draft Grade / ROI
**Goal:** Expand Draft tab with historical class view and value grading.
- Draft class by year (2023, 2024, 2025) — who drafted whom
- Current KTC value of each pick (value at time of draft vs. today)
- ROI grade per pick: bust / average / hit / home run (KTC delta + games started)
- Best/worst draft class per manager all-time

**Data source:** Sleeper draft API (partially built in `buildDraftHistory()`) + KTC values. **Complexity: Medium.**

---

### Phase 4 — Dynasty Prospect Tracker
**Goal:** Tab or section showing all rostered rookies/young players with KTC trend.
- Player name, age, position, team
- KTC dynasty value + trend (up/down/flat)
- Which TOL manager owns them
- "Rising star" badge for players under 24 with climbing KTC value

**Data source:** Sleeper rosters + KTC values (same as Phase 3). Build back-to-back with Phase 3. **Complexity: Medium.**

---

### Phase 5 — "Wrapped" Season Recaps
**Goal:** One shareable recap card per season per manager.
- Best week, worst week, luckiest win (won despite lower score via median system)
- Most points left on bench, biggest over/underperformance vs. projections
- "Your 2024 in one sentence" — AI-generated summary via `getTradeAI()` / Ask Claude layer

**Data source:** Weekly matchup data (requires all weekly data loaded first). **Complexity: Medium-high — finish data pull before building this.**

---

### Phase 6 — Roster Grades & Outlook
**Goal:** Per-team roster card showing dynasty health and outlook.
- KTC total roster value (ranked 1–12)
- Avg age of starters
- Win-now / contender / rebuilding classification
- Top 3 core assets
- Letter grade (A–F) with brief rationale

**Data source:** Sleeper rosters + KTC values (same as Phases 3–4). **Complexity: Medium — KTC integration is the key dependency.**

---

### Phase 7 — Trade Evaluator Enhancements *(already partially built)*
**Goal:** Extend the existing Trade Evaluator with deeper analysis.
- Two-panel input already exists; add scoring matrix detail view
- AI summary layer already wired via `getTradeAI()`; improve prompt quality
- Visitor-supplied API key flow for public users

**Data source:** Live Sleeper rosters + KTC + Anthropic API. **Complexity: High — build after Phases 3–6 establish KTC integration pattern.**

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- Do not introduce React, Vue, npm, or any build tool
- Do not break the single-file structure
- Do not remove the CORS fallback chain
- Do not delete `sendAI()`, `addMsg()`, `clearChat()`, `aiMessages`, or `LEAGUE_CONTEXT` — they are used by `getTradeAI()` in the Trade Evaluator
- Do not remove the `.cache-bar` DOM or its child IDs — they are used programmatically by `setCacheBar()` and `refreshData()`
- Do not revert to the old lime-green/blue/orange palette
- Do not use DM Mono for main content — it belongs only for intentional code/timestamp contexts
- Do not add the consolation winner card back to the home panel
- Do not add the sidebar back without explicit request
